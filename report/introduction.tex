As we further explore the vast universe and discover remote systems, our need to
simulate heavenly bodies (such as planets, stars, solarsystems and whole
galaxies) in astrophysics increases faster than ever before, in order to predict
positions of such bodies in time and space. The need for faster hardware, or
better performance/faster simulations can be improved by using parallelism and
more efficient algorithms.\\
Simulating heavenly bodies can be easily simulating in parallel using a naive
implementation. However, a naive implementation has an asymptotic runtime of
$O(n^2)$, which can be done better.\\
