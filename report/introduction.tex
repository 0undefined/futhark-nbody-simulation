As we further explore the vast universe and discover remote systems, our need to
simulate interactions between an ever increasing number of celestial bodies
(such as planets, stars, solarsystems and whole galaxies) continous to increase.
To do this we need high performance since the interactions can be complex, and
the number of bodies great. Therefore we need fast software, on fast hardware.

In terms of hardware we use GPU's, since the theoretical perfromance maximum
is vastly superior to CPU's, the task has to be suited for GPU's, which
\textit{n}-body simulations are. To obtain fast software we need clever algorithms,
and calculating these interactions can be done fairly easily, but a naive
implementation has an asymptotic runtime of $O(n^2)$, which is not ideal when we
want to simulate for a great deal of bodies.

In this report we will describe and implement the Barnes-Hut algorithm for
\textit{n}-body simulations. The Barnes-Hut algorithm uses clustering to obtain
an approximated result, but with a runtime of $O(n \cdot \log{n})$.
