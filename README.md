# Efficient clustered n-Body simulation in futhark

This project aims to implement the barnes-hut algorithm which runs in
_O(n log n)_ as compared to the naive version, which runs in _O(nÂ²)_.


# Result

Should be a comparison between a collection of implementations:

* The existing
  [futhark implementation](https://github.com/diku-dk/futhark-benchmarks/tree/master/accelerate/nbody).
* A naive barnes-hut implementation.
* A flat barnes-hut implementation, ie. Where we apply all flattening and other
  rules we learned from the
  [Parallel Functional Programming](https://kurser.ku.dk/course/ndak14009u/2019-2020)-course

Of the implementations we would compare speed and draw conclusions
scaling/implementation wise.


# Roadmap (country-roads edition)
