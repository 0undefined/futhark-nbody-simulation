It is definitely possible to create huge simulations using this method. Though
it might be unprecise due to the fact that we approximate distant bodies but
that is a tradeoff one have to decide application wise or adjust
$\theta$ accordingly to the requirements of the simulation.

We can conclude that the Barnes Hut heuristic can be implemented with a tree
such that the construction of the tree has a depth of $n \log n$ whilst the
traversal has a asymptotic work of $n^2 \log n$ -- though with a practical
speedup that increases proportianally with $n^2$ when compared with the naive
work of $n^2$.
