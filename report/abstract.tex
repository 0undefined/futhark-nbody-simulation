We shoved that it is possible to implement the Barnes Hut algorithm with a radix
tree and showed speedups on parallel hardware proportional to $n^2$ in relation
to the inputsize when compared to a naive implementation. Even though the
theoretical work asymptotically has increases by a factor of $\log n$.
